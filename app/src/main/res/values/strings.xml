    <string name="text_view">Algorithms to use when painting on the canvas.  When drawing a shape or image onto a canvas, different algorithms can be used to blend the pixels. The different values of BlendMode specify different such algorithms.  Each algorithm has two inputs, the source, which is the image being drawn, and the destination, which is the image into which the source image is being composited. The destination is often thought of as the background. The source and destination both have four color channels, the red, green, blue, and alpha channels. These are typically represented as numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The output of the algorithm also has these same four channels, with values computed from the source and destination.</string>
